## Caesar Cipher
Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

### Input
(string, integer)

### Output
string

### Time Complexity
O(n)

### Space Complexity
O(n)

## Substrings
Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and then an array of valid substrings as the second argument. It should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in the original string and how many times it was found.

### Input
(string, array)

### Output
hash

### Time Complexity
O(n*m)

### Space Complexity
O(n)

## Stock Picker
Implement a method #stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

### Input
array

### Output
array

### Time Complexity
O(n^2)

### Space Complexity
O(1)

## Bubble Sort
Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array.

### Input
array

### Output
array

### Time Complexity
Best: O(n)
Average: O(n^2)
Worst: O(n^2)

### Space Complexity
O(1)
